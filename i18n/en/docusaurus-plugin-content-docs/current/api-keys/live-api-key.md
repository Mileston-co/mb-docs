# Live API Key

Now, weâ€™re stepping into the real world of **crypto payments**â€”welcome to the **Live API Key**! With this key, youâ€™re all set to accept actual payments that hold **real monetary value**. ðŸ’°

---

### What Is a Live API Key?

The **Live API Key** is your gateway to receiving real payments in **USDC**, directly into your business account. Unlike the test API key, this is where the magic happens for your production environment! A sample live API key looks like this:  
`Mileston_LIVE_ssh83838ssaala......`

Hereâ€™s what you can do with a live API key:

- **Receive Real Payments**: Accept crypto payments from your users.
- **Effortless Payouts**: Payments are settled in **USDC** and credited to your business wallet on the **SUI network**.
- **Seamless Blockchain Support**: Mileston handles all the blockchain complexities for youâ€”so you can focus on scaling your business. ðŸš€

### How to Use Your Live API Key

1. **Switch to Live Mode**: In your [business dashboard](https://business.mileston.co), toggle to **Live Mode** before generating your live API key.
2. **Keep It Secure**: Never expose your live API key in frontend code or public repositories. Always store it securely in environment variables. ðŸ”’
3. **Pair with Your Business ID**: Combine your live API key with your **Business ID** (found in the dropdown beside your business logo in the dashboard).

### Using API Keys in Production

In production, use the **Live API Key** for secure operations:

- **Normal API Key**: Use in your backend to handle real payments, create invoices, and manage recurring payments.
- **Checkout API Key**: Use in your frontend to securely initiate payments and fetch payment statuses.
