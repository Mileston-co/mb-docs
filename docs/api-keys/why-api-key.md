# Why Use API Keys?

**API Keys** are essential for integrating with Mileston's APIs. They play a crucial role in enabling secure and efficient communication between your application and our services. Here's why we use API keys:

- **Programmatically Create Payments**: API keys allow your application to create payment links, invoices, and recurring payments programmatically, making your workflows seamless and automated.  
- **Business Authorization**: Each API key is unique to your business, ensuring that only authorized applications can interact with your account.  
- **Enhanced Security**: API keys provide a secure way to authenticate requests, protecting sensitive data and ensuring only verified calls are processed.  
- **Simplified Integration**: With API keys, there‚Äôs no need for complex authentication mechanisms. It‚Äôs straightforward to use across various platforms.  

### Combine API Keys with Your Business ID  
Alongside your API key, you‚Äôll also need your **Business ID** to authorize API requests. Your Business ID can be found in the dropdown menu beside your business logo in the dashboard.  

Once you have your API key and Business ID, you're all set to use our APIs! üöÄ
