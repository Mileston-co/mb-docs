# Test API Key

Mileston makes it easy for you to simulate real-world crypto payments using our **Test API Key**. Since we’re a crypto payment gateway, we understand the importance of testing your setup without worrying about real money. That’s why we offer seamless integration with **testnet environments** across supported blockchains.

---

### Supported Blockchains

Mileston currently supports the following blockchains for payments, with **more coming soon**:

- **Sui**
- **Polygon**
- **Ethereum**
- **Base**

Don’t sweat the technical details! We’ve done all the heavy lifting for you. You just need to focus on building your application while Mileston handles the blockchain complexities.

### What Is a Test API Key?

A **Test API Key** allows you to create payments on the testnet and use **faucet tokens** to mimic real payments. It’s a risk-free way to test the integration without monetary value. 🎉

A sample test API key looks like this:  
`Mileston_TEST_jsj88js838jskjaaksj83jw....`

Using a test API key, you can:

- Create test payments and invoices.
- Verify how payments flow in your app.
- Simulate user interactions with mock payments.

---

### Testing with API Keys

When testing your integration, use the **Test API Key** in both backend and frontend environments:

- **Normal API Key**: Use in your backend to simulate creating payment links, invoices, and recurring payments.
- **Checkout API Key**: Use in your frontend to test payment initiation and status retrieval.
